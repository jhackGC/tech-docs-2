# Testing and Deployment

_Best practices for testing microservices and deploying them efficiently._

---

## Testing

> When it comes to microservices, we can't understate the importance of rigorous testing and streamlined deployment processes.

Let's now see some of the patterns and best practices related to these two important topics.

### Environments

Having different environments allows us to isolate changes and identify issues early on:

- Safely break things while experimenting
- Catch bugs before they have real impact

**Typical environments:**

- Development
- Staging (mirrors production)
- Production (prod)

> It's important to keep these environments consistent, as otherwise you risk bugs making their way into production or flaky test environments that fail without real bugs.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment

**_Continuous integration (CI)_** is a practice where changes are integrated to the main repository many times per day, and each change is automatically built and tested to catch bugs as early as possible.

This avoids the pain of having to integrate branches after having worked on them for weeks.

**_Continuous deployment (CD)_** means every change that passes the test is automatically deployed into production.

> These tools are all about speed and reliability. When we release smaller updates more frequently, we lower the risk as problems are detected earlier, less time is wasted, rollbacks are easier, and the automation decreases the likelihood of human error.

### Tools

**Common CI/CD tools:**

- Jenkins
- GitLab
- GitHub Actions
- CircleCI

### Performance Testing

In addition to the tests we've mentioned, it's also useful to have performance tests.

- Measure responsiveness and stability of services under various conditions
- Check how quickly a service handles a request or how many concurrent requests it can handle

**_Load testing_** is a subset of performance testing, which checks how the system reacts to a large number of users.

> For example, for an event booking system, this means simulating 10,000 people buying a ticket after a big star announces a new concert, allowing them to be prepared for when this scenario happens in reality.

**Common performance/load testing tools:**

- Apache JMeter
- Gatling
- LoadRunner
- K6

### Node.js Testing Tools

**Popular tools for testing Node.js microservices:**

- Mocha _(test framework)_
- Jest _(test framework, assertion, and mocking)_
- Chai _(assertion library)_
- Supertest _(HTTP assertions for REST APIs)_
- Sinon _(spies, mocks, and stubs)_
- nock _(HTTP server mocking)_

# Deployment

There are also useful patterns and best practices when deploying microservices.

## Rolling Upgrades

- Achieve zero downtime by upgrading service instances in chunks
- Some instances serve requests with the old version, others with the new version
- Ensures the system is operational during the whole process

> Keep in mind: When deploying changes, some instances may still be running older versions for some time.

## Canary Deployments

- Ship changes to a subset of instances
- Test new features in production before rolling out to all instances

## Feature Flags

One way to deal with this problem of new features taking a long time to be deployed to all instances is to use feature flags

- Work on new features but keep them inactive
- Use Boolean flags (or more complex flags) to control feature rollout
- Feature flags can be set dynamically without redeployment
- Turn features on/off much quicker than redeploying all instances
- Enable targeting features to specific customers or early adopters

**Popular feature flag tools for Node.js:**

- LaunchDarkly _(feature management platform with Node.js SDK)_
- Unleash _(open-source feature flag service with Node.js client)_
- Flagsmith _(feature flag and remote config service, Node.js SDK available)_
- ConfigCat _(feature flag service with Node.js SDK)_
- Split.io _(feature flag and experimentation platform, Node.js SDK)_

> Feature flags are closely related to A/B testing and experimentation.

## A/B Testing

- Ship two versions of a feature
- Show different versions to different users
- Compare results to decide which version to use
- Commonly used for UI changes, but also applicable to backend features

## Deployment Tools & Libraries

**Industry-standard tools:**

- Kubernetes _(container orchestration, widely used for microservices)_
- Docker _(containerization platform)_
- Helm _(Kubernetes package manager)_
- Terraform _(infrastructure as code)_
- Ansible _(automation and configuration management)_
- AWS ECS / EKS _(managed container services)_
- Azure Container Instances / AKS _(managed container services)_

**Node.js-specific tools/libraries:**

- PM2 _(Node.js process manager with zero-downtime reloads and cluster mode)_
- Nodemon _(auto-restarts Node.js apps on changes, useful in dev)_
- Shipit _(deployment automation for Node.js projects)_
- node-deploy _(simple deployment tool for Node.js)_
