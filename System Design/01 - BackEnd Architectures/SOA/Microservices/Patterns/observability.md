# Observability

Best practices for monitoring, logging, and tracing in microservices architectures.

---

## Why Observability Matters

Understanding what's happening inside your microservices architecture is crucial for:

- Daily operations
- Long-term maintenance
- Diagnosing issues across distributed services

---

## Key Practices

### 1. Logging

- Use a consistent log format across all services
- Aggregate logs in a centralized location
- Correlate requests using unique IDs, use correlation IDs to trace requests across services

**Popular tools:**

- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** Collects, stores, and visualizes logs from multiple sources.
- **Loki:** Efficient log aggregation system designed for cloud-native environments.
- **Fluentd:** Open-source data collector for unified logging.
- **Splunk:** Enterprise platform for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data.

### 2. Metrics

- Collect metrics from all services
- Aggregate metrics in dashboards
- Monitor CPU, memory, success rates, queue lengths, etc.

**Popular tools:**

- **Prometheus (metrics):** Monitors and collects time-series metrics from services.
- **Grafana (visualization):** Visualizes metrics and dashboards from various data sources.
- **Zabbix:** Monitors network, servers, and applications, providing metrics and alerts.

### 3. Alerts

- Set up automated alerts for anomalies
- Use email, Slack, or SMS for notifications

**Popular tools:**

- **PagerDuty:** Incident response platform that sends alerts and manages on-call schedules.

### 4. Distributed Tracing

- Trace requests as they flow through multiple services
- Use unique IDs to correlate actions

**Popular tools:**

- **Zipkin:** Traces requests across microservices to diagnose latency issues.
- **Jaeger:** Distributed tracing system for monitoring and troubleshooting transactions.
- **Datadog (cloud-based):** Cloud-based platform for monitoring, tracing, and logging across infrastructure and applications.

## Summary

Effective observability in microservices requires:

- Centralized logging
- Aggregated metrics and dashboards
- Automated alerts
- Distributed tracing

These practices help teams quickly detect, diagnose, and resolve issues in complex, distributed systems.
