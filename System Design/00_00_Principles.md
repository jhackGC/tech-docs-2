Modern software development is guided by a set of **core design principles** that help create codebases that are scalable, maintainable, and robust.

These principles span architectural thinking, object-oriented design, functional paradigms, and clean code practices. Here's a breakdown of the most influential:

---

## ðŸ”· 1. **SOLID Principles** _(Object-Oriented Design)_

These five principles are foundational for building maintainable and scalable software:

### âœ… **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> A class or module should have only one reason to change.
> **Why it matters:** Encourages modularity and easier testing.

### âœ… **O** - Open/Closed Principle

> Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
> **Why it matters:** Enables safe updates and feature additions.

### âœ… **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle

> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering correctness.
> **Why it matters:** Ensures polymorphism works as expected.

### âœ… **I** - Interface Segregation Principle

> No client should be forced to depend on interfaces it doesnâ€™t use.
> **Why it matters:** Avoids bloated interfaces and tight coupling.

### âœ… **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
> **Why it matters:** Decouples systems, improving testability and flexibility.

---

## ðŸ”· 2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

> Simplicity is better than complexity.
> Avoid overengineering; the simplest solution is usually best.

---

## ðŸ”· 3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation in the system.
> Encourages reuse and reduces bugs caused by inconsistent logic.

---

## ðŸ”· 4. **YAGNI (You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It)**

> Donâ€™t implement something until itâ€™s actually needed.
> Helps prevent scope creep and overcomplication.

---

## ðŸ”· 5. **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**

> Different parts of a system should focus on different responsibilities.
> For example, separating data access, business logic, and UI.

---

## ðŸ”· 6. **Encapsulation**

> Hide internal details and expose only necessary interfaces.
> Limits interdependencies and allows modules to change without breaking others.

---

## ðŸ”· 7. **Composition Over Inheritance**

> Favor building systems from small, composable behaviors over deep inheritance hierarchies.
> Improves flexibility and avoids fragile base class problems.

---

## ðŸ”· 8. **Law of Demeter (LoD)**

> A unit should only talk to its immediate collaborators.
> Also called the _"Principle of Least Knowledge"_. Avoids chaining and tight coupling.

---

## ðŸ”· 9. **High Cohesion, Low Coupling**

- **High cohesion:** Functions in a module/class are related and focused.
- **Low coupling:** Modules/classes are independent and interact through clear interfaces.

**Why it matters:** Easier to change, test, and maintain.

---

## ðŸ”· 10. **Design for Change (Flexibility)**

> Software should be designed with future evolution in mind.
> Using patterns like Strategy, Factory, Observer, etc., helps with this.

---

## ðŸ”· 11. **Testability and Observability**

> Design should enable easy testing and debugging.
> Includes dependency injection, mocks, clean logs, and predictable flow.

## ðŸ”· 12. **Principle of least astonishment**

> A system or interface should behave to minimize surprises or confusion for users or programmers.

## Bonus: Functional Principles Gaining Popularity

- **Immutability**: Avoid shared mutable state. [Immutability Guide](./00_20_Immutability.md)
- **Pure functions**: No side effects. [Pure Functions](./00_21_PureFunctions.md)
- **Declarative over imperative**: Focus on _what_ rather than _how_. [Declarative over imperative](./00_22_Declarative_over_Imperative.md)
