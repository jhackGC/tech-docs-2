# How to identify design issues in a Node.js application

How to identify design issues in a Node.js application, what symptoms to look for, and **which software engineering principles** are being violated in each case:

## Summary

Identifying **design issues in a Node.js application** requires a combination of technical review, performance monitoring, code quality checks, and sometimes architectural analysis. Here’s a structured way to do it:

---

## ✅ 1. **Code Structure & Modularity**

Check if the code is:

- ❌ **Monolithic** instead of modular (huge files, all logic in one place)
- ❌ **Tightly coupled** components (business logic mixed with database or UI code)
- ❌ Lack of clear **folder structure** (e.g., `controllers`, `services`, `routes`, `models`)
- ✅ Good use of **design patterns** (MVC, repository, strategy, etc.)

### 🔍 Look for:

- Massive files combining multiple responsibilities
- No clear distinction between business logic, data access, and routing
- Hard-coded values spread throughout the codebase
- Shared mutable state

### 🧠 Violated principles:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – each module/class should have one reason to change.
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** – logic, UI, and data access should be separate.
- **Encapsulation** – implementation details should be hidden behind clear interfaces.

### ✅ Good Practice / How to fix:

- Apply separation of concerns (SoC), move toward service-based or layered architecture.
- Organize into folders like `/controllers`, `/services`, `/repositories`, and avoid mixing responsibilities in the same file.

---

## ✅ 2. **Error Handling**

- ❌ Missing try/catch in async/await or unhandled `Promise`s
- ❌ No centralized error handler (especially in Express)
- ❌ Leaking stack traces to users

**How to fix**: Use centralized middleware for error handling, add logging and proper error types.

---

## ✅ 3. **Asynchronous Design Problems**

- ❌ Blocking operations (e.g., `fs.readFileSync`, heavy CPU tasks in main thread)
- ❌ Unhandled async errors
- ❌ Callback hell or inconsistent use of async/await

**How to fix**: Always prefer async versions of functions, offload CPU work (e.g., to worker threads or queues), and handle async errors explicitly.

---

## ✅ 4. **Scalability & Maintainability**

- ❌ Business logic scattered throughout routes
- ❌ No environment separation (e.g., `dev`, `prod`)
- ❌ Missing dependency injection or overly manual wiring

**How to fix**: Use configuration management, environment-specific settings, DI libraries like `awilix` or `typedi` if needed.

---

## ✅ 5. **Dependency Issues**

- ❌ Unused packages, too many dependencies
- ❌ Vulnerable packages (check with `npm audit`)
- ❌ Copy-pasted or duplicated code

**How to fix**: Run `npm prune`, `npm audit fix`, and refactor duplicate code into utils/services.

---

## ✅ 6. **Performance Bottlenecks**

Use profiling tools to identify:

- 🚨 Memory leaks
- 🚨 Event loop blocks
- 🚨 Slow database queries or I/O

**Tools**:

- Node.js built-in profiler (`--inspect`)
- Chrome DevTools (for back-end debugging)
- `clinic.js` (`clinic doctor`, `clinic flame`)
- `New Relic`, `Datadog`, or `AppSignal` for APM

---

## ✅ 7. **Testing & Observability**

- ❌ No unit or integration tests
- ❌ Missing logging or metrics
- ❌ No traceability in complex flows

**Fix**: Add tests (use Jest, Mocha), use structured logging (`winston`, `pino`), and add observability (OpenTelemetry, Sentry, etc.)

---

## ✅ 8. **Security Weaknesses**

- ❌ Missing input validation (risk of injection attacks)
- ❌ Hardcoded secrets or API keys
- ❌ No rate limiting, CORS misconfigurations

**Fix**: Use:

- `helmet` for security headers
- `express-validator` or `zod` for validation
- `dotenv` for environment variables
- `rate-limiter-flexible` or similar

---

## ✅ 9. **Linting, Formatting & Docs**

- ❌ Inconsistent code style
- ❌ No ESLint or Prettier
- ❌ Missing JSDoc or README

**Fix**: Set up `eslint`, `prettier`, and a good `README.md` with setup instructions and API docs.

### 🧪 Bonus: Checklist for Design Review

| Area          | Questions to Ask                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Structure     | Is the app modular and maintainable?        |
| Performance   | Are there slow operations or blocking code? |
| Security      | Are inputs validated? Any secrets exposed?  |
| Testing       | Are there enough tests? Are they fast?      |
| Observability | Are errors/logs clear and useful?           |
| Scaling       | Can you deploy this to multiple instances?  |

---

## 1. 🔧 **Code Structure & Modularity**

---

## 2. 🛑 **Error Handling**

### 🔍 Look for:

- Silent failures
- Missing try/catch in async/await blocks
- Redundant error handling (e.g., same code repeated in every route)
- Errors returned to the user with full stack traces

### 🧠 Violated principles:

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** – same error structure in many places
- **Fail Fast** – errors should be surfaced predictably
- **Open/Closed Principle** – hardcoded error formats make the code hard to extend

### ✅ Good Practice:

Use centralized error-handling middleware and custom error classes (e.g., `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`).

---

## 3. ⚙️ **Asynchronous Design Problems**

### 🔍 Look for:

- Use of synchronous APIs (`fs.readFileSync`, `bcrypt.compareSync`) in web request paths
- `async` functions that don’t `await`
- Mixing callbacks, promises, and async/await inconsistently

### 🧠 Violated principles:

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** – complexity introduced through mixed async patterns
- **Least Astonishment (POLA)** – async patterns should be predictable and consistent
- **SRP** – if one function is doing async, error handling, and formatting output, it’s doing too much

### ✅ Good Practice:

Standardize async with `async/await` and handle errors gracefully with try/catch or promise `.catch`.
And handle responsibilities separately

---

## 4. 🧱 **Scalability & Maintainability**

### 🔍 Look for:

- Business logic in route files
- Global variables
- No environment separation (e.g., hardcoded API keys or URLs)
- Direct imports instead of DI (Dependency Injection)

### 🧠 Violated principles:

- **Dependency Inversion Principle** – high-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level ones directly
- **Configuration over hardcoding** – breaks **Open/Closed Principle**
- **Scalability via Composition** – not followed when logic is entangled

### ✅ Good Practice:

Use environment configs, DI containers (`awilix`, `typedi`, `NestJS`), and service layers to encapsulate logic.

---

## 5. 🧩 **Dependency Management**

### 🔍 Look for:

- Unused packages
- Outdated/vulnerable dependencies (`npm audit`)
- Bundled code from StackOverflow (copy-paste smell)
- Lack of internal utility libraries

### 🧠 Violated principles:

- **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)** – excess dependencies
- **DRY** – multiple packages doing the same job
- **Security First** – ignored when unvetted packages are installed

### ✅ Good Practice:

Audit dependencies regularly and use internal helpers to do simple reusable tasks instead of overloading `npm`.

---

## 6. 🚦 **Performance Bottlenecks**

### 🔍 Look for:

- Long response times
- Blocking operations on main thread
- Large memory usage over time (potential leaks)

### 🧠 Violated principles:

- **Responsiveness** – important in reactive, real-time systems
- **KISS** – if you complicate logic instead of offloading work (e.g., to workers/queues)
- **SRP** – long functions often violate SRP and hide performance issues

### ✅ Good Practice:

Use tools like `clinic.js`, Node Inspector, or APMs to detect and optimize slow paths.

---

## 7. ✅ **Testing & Observability**

### 🔍 Look for:

- No unit or integration tests
- No structured logs or traceability
- Console.log in production

### 🧠 Violated principles:

- **Fail Fast** – lack of tests means bugs show up late
- **DRY** – repeated test logic, or no reuse in test setup
- **SRP** – if logs, logic, and DB access are in the same function, testability suffers

### ✅ Good Practice:

Use structured logs (`winston`, `pino`), observability (Sentry, OpenTelemetry), and test frameworks like `Jest`, `Supertest`.

---

## 8. 🔐 **Security Weaknesses**

### 🔍 Look for:

- Missing input validation
- SQL/NoSQL injection
- Secrets in codebase
- No rate limiting or CORS misconfigurations

### 🧠 Violated principles:

- **Least Privilege** – services/components should only access what they need
- **Secure by Design** – must be considered from the beginning
- **KISS** – complex error messages or inconsistent validation logic

### ✅ Good Practice:

- Validate all input (`zod`, `joi`, `express-validator`)
- Use `.env` for secrets
- Use libraries like `helmet`, `cors`, `csurf`

---

## 9. 🧽 **Linting, Formatting, Docs**

### 🔍 Look for:

- Inconsistent code styles
- No lint rules
- No documentation or usage examples

### 🧠 Violated principles:

- **Readability is maintainability**
- **KISS** – messy code makes debugging harder
- **DRY** – no code reuse, unclear intent

### ✅ Good Practice:

Set up `eslint`, `prettier`, and write minimal README + inline JSDoc for devs and future you.
