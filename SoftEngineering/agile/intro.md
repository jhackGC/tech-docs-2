# Agile development

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

- Working software over comprehensive documentation

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

- Responding to change over following a plan

Embrace change

Kent Beck

##  Principles
1 - early and continuously -> valuable software
2 - welcome changing requirements, to help the customer to compete
3 - deliver frequently, receive frequent feedback
4 - Business and devs work together: joint ownership
5 - build projects around motivated individuals
servant leadership: supports and seeks what motivates people.
6 - Face to face best. e.g. Helps to read body lang.
7 - Working software is the primary measure of progress, with biz value
8 - sustainable pace of work, do not burn out, or bore.
9 - keep things simple and focused on what the customer needs, meet the requirement in the simplest manner.
11 - Self organizing, do its work without significant help from the outside. Occasionally need input
12 - Inspect and adapt how they work to become more efficient on a regular basis


# Agile framework: Scrum
Framework that facilitates the building of complex products.
Its a framework, not a methodology, so it is abstract, not prescriptive.
General guidelines.
Lightweight

Has:

 - 3 team roles
    1 - Product owner
    2 - Dev team members
    3 - Scrum master

 - 5 events
    1 - Sprint
    2 - Sprint planning
    3 - Daily scrum
    4 - Sprint Review
    5 - Sprint Retrospective: efficiency improvement

 - 3 artifacts

    1 - Product backlog
       - only TO DO list. Product Owner accountable for it.
       - contains:
            - requirements
            - enhancement requirements
            - defects
            - user stories
            - new features
       - smaller and easier items at the top (easier to estimate and implement)
       - larger items are divided into smaller by grooming or *refinement*. refinement is not a scrum event. Product refinement is for large items that are going to be implemented in one or two sprints ahead. After the refinement process , top items are more detailed and mostly ready to estimate and / or implement


    2 - Sprint backlog
        - subset of Product Backlog items selected for the sprint
        - Contains items selected for the sprint, plus tasks specific to the dev                team sample
        - the dev team updates the sprint backlog during the sprint

    3 - Product increment
        - product at the end of the sprint
        - current "done" version of the product itself
        - should be usable and provide some business value, polished

        Feature teams:
        - An implemented feature that provides end-to-end biz functionality are a vertically sliced portion of the system.
        - Feature Teams: optimal way to implement it is to use a feature team, they  are cross-functional and have the ability to implement end-to-end functionality.

        Component teams:
        - focused on layers, or areas or compnents (db, ui, biz logic, etc)
        - specialized around a specific component
        - many of these teams are needed to build a feature


- Sprint, timeframe to deliver a product iteration
    - Begins with sprint planning where the team works with the owner to pick the srpint items from the product backlog.
    - Dev team defines the sprint goal high level and concise
    - Dev team creates plan to create a product increment, usable and shippable product
