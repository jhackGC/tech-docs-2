## The Resources

Something really important is that you choose to learn from good sources. Just like it's important to get your news from quality sources, it's important to get your technical information from sound sources. Here are some of my personal favorites:

- For anything to do with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, Mozilla's [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is my go-to. I literally have it open all the time.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) has fashioned itself into a premier development website. It has great content not just for CSS but for HTML and JavaScript too. If I want a tutorial, I'll head there. If I want more technical how-to info, I head to MDN.
- For video content, you really can't beat the rest of the content on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/beginner/). I love it.
- If I'm working with a library or a framework, it's a good idea to head directly to their [GitHub](https://github.com/) (we'll talk about GitHub later) page or their official documentation. It's best to head straight to the source.

Frontend Masters also puts out a really awesome book every year called the [Frontend Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/guides/front-end-handbook/2019/). It's a good way to get an overview of the whole industry.
