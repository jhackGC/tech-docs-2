# HTML Project

_Content from: [Complete Intro to Web Dev v3 - HTML Project](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/html/html-project)_

Here is your first HTML project!

We're making your personal blog. Feel free to use the project we started in the last lesson. Here are your requirements:

## Project Requirements

### Both Pages

- Your blog has two pages: `index.html` and `about.html`

### Index Page (index.html)

- Your `index.html` needs a title and a quick intro
- Your index also needs a link to `about.html`
- Your blog must have five posts on it (you can just keep it all on the same page)

### Blog Posts

Each post needs:

- A title
- An author
- The date it was posted (feel free to make up times)
- The text of the blog post. Bonus points if there are multiple paragraphs. Feel free to use [Lorem Ipsum](https://loremipsum.io/) if you want placeholder text
- Bonus points for images

### About Page (about.html)

Your `about.html` needs:

- The name of your blog
- A few paragraphs about you
- A list of your recent jobs/schools/accomplishments

## Adding Images

Quick note on how to do an image: put the image in the same directory as the `index.html` and `about.html` and then put:

```html
<img
  src="the-name-of-the-file.jpg"
  alt="a text description of what the image is for sight-impaired folks"
/>
```

to render the image.

## Styling Note

This will mostly be black and white and that's okay. You can come back and restyle this later with CSS.

## Example

Here is my example: [Brian's Blog](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/project-files/blog/index.html) (you'll have to right click and say "View Source")

## Project Goals

This project will help you:

- Practice creating multi-page HTML websites
- Learn to use different HTML tags appropriately
- Understand document structure and navigation between pages
- Build a foundation for adding CSS styling later
- Create a practical project you can expand upon
