# v8

Node JS is built on top of Google Chrome V8's processor

Node is based and EXTENDS V8 JS engine, it extends it with I/O.
V8 has no idea of I/O as it can run anywhere, and I/O is different in each platform (web, mobile, raspberry pi, etc.)

Node provides a HOSTING ENVIRONMENT for that JS engine called V8.

The browser does the same, provides a hosting environment for that JS. Same for the raspberry pi SDK, and what it does
is to extend what you can do with javascript to an environment, like writing to a screen, or open a file, do an ajax
request.

Many things done in the browser ar e not javascript, are extensions provided b the hosting environment, the browser.
S when you do console.log, that uses environment hooks to do something, inthe browser the dev tools print it to the
console, in the node env, it prints to the std out.

so in the node env, console.log(...) means process.stdout.write(...);


the Node v8 module could be useful for checking memory usage e.g.
