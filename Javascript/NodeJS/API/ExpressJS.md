## Express

Express.js is a really neat and highly adopted framework for Node.js that makes it trivial to build an API. It's by far the most popular one due to it being created near Node.js' time of creation and how much support the community has poured into it.

Express is synomous with Django for Python, Sinatra for Ruby, Spring for Java, and Gin for Go Lang
