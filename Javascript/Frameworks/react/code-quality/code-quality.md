1.  **Component Organization**📁

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use meaningful folder structure (e.g., features, shared, utils)

2.  **State Management** 🔄

- Choose appropriate state management tools based on complexity
- Consider using `useReducer` for complex state logic
- Keep state as close as possible to where it's used
- Avoid prop drilling by using Context or state management libraries

3.  **Error Handling** ⚠️

- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add input validation
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Use meaningful error messages

4.  **Performance** ⚡

- Use React.memo() for expensive renders
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use lazy loading for large components

5.  **Code Style** 📝

- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Implement proper PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces

6.  **Testing** 🧪

- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Test edge cases
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Implement integration tests for user flows
