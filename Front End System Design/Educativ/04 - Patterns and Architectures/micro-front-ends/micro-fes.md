caling Development Using Micro-Frontend Architecture
Learn how micro-frontend architecture enables modular frontend development, improves scalability, and facilitates independent deployment in large applications.

As frontend applications have grown in size, complexity, and user expectations, so have the challenges of scaling frontend development, technically and organizationally. Managing a single-page application (SPA) or multi-page application (MPA) works fine in small to mid-sized apps. A single team can oversee the entire UI, deploy changes quickly, and maintain consistent code practices.

But what happens when we’re building a large-scale application like a social media platform, e-commerce site, or streaming service with multiple feature-rich modules like home feed, search, notifications, messaging, and user profiles?

We eventually reach a tipping point where:

The SPA monolith becomes fragile, tightly coupled, and slow to build or deploy.

Teams step on each other’s toes, merging changes into a massive shared repo.

Releasing one small update requires retesting the entire app.

Onboarding new developers takes longer because of the overwhelming codebase.

This is the same set of challenges that once led to the rise of microservices on the backend, splitting a monolithic service into independent, loosely coupled services owned by autonomous teams.

So the question naturally follows:

Note: If microservices work so well on the backend, why not apply similar principles to the frontend?

Let’s explore micro-frontend architecture meant to solve the above problem.

What is micro-frontend architecture?
Micro-frontend architecture is a design approach that structures a frontend application as a composition of independent, self-contained feature modules (or “fragments”), each responsible for a specific domain or functionality. These units are developed using independent codebases and even (in some cases) different frontend frameworks or technologies deployed and owned by separate teams, similar to microservices on the backend.

Each module includes its own:

Business logic

UI components

Styling

Optionally, even its routing and state

Think of a web page as a city block. In a traditional monolithic frontend (SPA), the entire block is designed, constructed, and maintained by a single team, one massive blueprint for everything. In contrast, each building (header, newsfeed, sidebar, notifications) is independently designed, built, and maintained in a micro-frontend architecture.

Note: From the user’s perspective, the app should feel seamless. From the team’s perspective, it’s modular, scalable, and loosely coupled.

Next, we will explore the strategies used to implement micro-frontends.

Implementation strategies in micro-frontend
Micro-frontends aim to simplify frontend development by breaking the app into independently owned sections, but the actual implementation can differ greatly depending on the project’s needs and architecture. Different applications and teams require different flexibility, performance, and control degrees. That’s why several implementation strategies exist, categorized primarily into:

Build-time integration: In build-time integration, all micro-frontends are bundled together during the build process. Each team publishes its micro-frontend as a package or remote module, and a central application (or shell) consumes and assembles them.

Run-time integration (client-side): In this model, each micro-frontend is deployed independently and dynamically loaded into the shell application at runtime. Technologies like single-SPA, web components, or custom JS loaders inject micro-frontends on the fly.

Server-side composition: The backend is responsible for stitching together different micro-frontend outputs before sending the final page to the client. Each team exposes HTML fragments or components through APIs, which are then composed using server-side includes, template engines, or a BFF layer.

The following table compares the above approaches:

Complex orchestration on the server, potential latency bottlenecks

News portals, search engines, landing pages with dynamic data

With implementation strategies in place (build-time, runtime, or server-side), the next major challenge in micro-frontend architecture is routing. How does navigation work across the app without breaking context or consistency when different UI parts are independently owned?

Routing in micro-frontend applications
Routing in a monolithic SPA is relatively straightforward; a central router defines which component renders for which URL. It becomes more nuanced in a micro-frontend architecture, where teams may own and deploy different UI parts. We should explore how routes get matched to independently owned micro-frontends and how internal navigations happen without triggering a full reload.

Let’s look at the primary models used in micro-frontend routing.

Centralized (global) routing: A shell application owns the global routing configuration in this approach. It determines which micro-frontend should be rendered for each route. For example: /feed loads the newsfeed micro-frontend, /messages loads the chat micro-frontend. The shell handles the route-to-component mapping and lazy-loads the appropriate module. It ensures consistency, as there is a single source of truth for routing.

Challenge: All micro-frontends must expose their routing paths clearly and remain in sync with the shell. To mitigate this challenge, we propose decentralized routing.

Decentralized (nested) routing: Each micro-frontend owns its internal routing logic, often nested under a root route handled by the shell. For example, the shell loads the settings micro-frontend on /settings, but /settings/profile and /settings/password are handled internally by that micro-frontend.

Challenge: It requires coordination to prevent conflicting routes and ensure deep linking works correctly. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a hybrid approach.

Hybrid routing: A hybrid model combines both; the shell owns top-level routing, and micro-frontends manage their local sub-routes. This is the most common pattern in large systems. For example:

A user navigates to /dashboard/settings/password

Shell sees /dashboard and loads dashboard micro-frontend

Dashboard micro-frontend handles /settings/password locally

This separation of concerns gives teams freedom while still keeping top-level navigation predictable.

Tools for routing
Once routing is in place and micro-frontends can load independently based on URLs, the next challenge is how these pieces communicate. Even though they’re meant to be isolated, real-world UIs often require shared state or coordination across boundaries, especially in apps with authentication, themes, or shared user preferences.

Communication and state sharing in micro-frontends
While the goal of micro-frontend architecture is independent ownership, in reality, modules don’t exist in silos. They often need to share states or react to each other. For example:

A login micro-frontend updates the user’s authentication status, which must be reflected in the navigation bar or profile menu.

A language selector changes the app’s locale, impacting content rendered by multiple other micro-frontends.

A notification module might need to alert the visible micro-frontend to refresh data or respond to user actions in real-time.

To support such use cases, micro-frontend communication must be carefully designed to prevent tight coupling while enabling essential interactions. The common communication strategies include:

Custom events (Pub/Sub pattern): Micro-frontends can dispatch and listen to custom browser events to communicate. This enables loose coupling, especially for cross-feature notifications. For example, the following code listens and publish custom events whenever they occur:

  Shared state via global store: Some teams adopt a shared state container like Redux, Zustand, or even simple context providers, hosted in the shell app and exposed to micro-frontends via a global object.

Cross-window communication: For hard-isolated micro-frontends (e.g., using iFrames), postMessage is used for sandboxed communication. It provides full isolation and security but requires manual and verbose handling of messages and listeners.

Session management and authentication: Managing user sessions in micro-frontends can be challenging, especially when modules are isolated. A centralized auth system (like OAuth) ensures consistent user identity across modules. However, since micro-frontends may not share runtime context, the session state (e.g., tokens or login status) must be explicitly shared via the global state.

Note: A good rule of thumb is to keep the shared state minimal and intentional. Only share what must be global, like authentication, theme, or language, and let each micro-frontend manage its internal state.

Now that we’ve explored how micro-frontends communicate and share state while aiming to stay modular, it’s important to acknowledge that this architecture comes at a cost. Micro-frontends solve many problems and introduce new challenges and trade-offs that teams must manage carefully.

In a micro-frontend architecture where each module manages its own local state, what trade-offs should teams consider when deciding whether to also use a shared global state for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, theme, or language? Enter your answer in the widget below.

Challenges in micro-frontend
Micro-frontends enable scalability, autonomy, and parallel development but also bring in architectural overhead, performance concerns, and complex coordination challenges. The following table provides an overview of challenges and their mitigation:

Challenge

Why It Happens

Potential Impact

How to Mitigate

Performance overhead

Duplicate libraries and dependencies across micro-frontends

Slower load times, larger bundles

Use shared modules, lazy loading, module federation

Design inconsistency

Teams using different versions or interpretations of design systems

UI feels fragmented, broken user experience

Enforce shared design libraries and visual testing

Testing across boundaries

Independently deployed features can’t be tested in isolation for full workflows.

Bugs emerge in integration, harder quality assurance coverage

Add end-to-end tests in the shell and define API contracts (defining expected behavior)

Routing and state complexity

Shared navigation and state need to be coordinated manually

Broken navigation, state desync

Centralize routing and document shared state and events

Deployment complexity

Each micro-frontend needs its pipeline and integration

Slower releases, harder CI/CD maintenance

Automate builds, use manifests and shell-based coordination

Note: Module federation is a feature of Webpack 5 that allows independently built and deployed JavaScript applications (like micro-frontends) to dynamically share code at runtime. It enables apps to expose and consume modules from each other without needing to recompile or bundle everything together.

Q1 / Q2
Understanding the challenges and trade-offs helps us realize that micro-frontends aren’t a magical solution. They solve specific organizational and architectural problems but come with real complexity. So, when should you embrace this model, and when is it better to keep things simple?

When to use micro-frontends
Micro-frontends are powerful, but they’re not for everyone. They add architectural overhead, so adopting them intentionally is important, not just because they’re trending. Here’s how to evaluate whether micro-frontends are the right fit:

Multiple teams work on different frontend parts, with independent roadmaps and ownership boundaries.

The application is feature-rich and complex, with a long-term roadmap that would benefit from independent scaling.

Teams must deploy independently without coordinating every release with other app parts.

Different system parts must use different frontend stacks (e.g., legacy + modern migration).

Frontend modules must align with microservices on the backend, reducing coupling across vertical slices.

Note: A well-structured SPA or modular monolith may serve you better if you’re building something small, fast-moving, or single-purpose.

Conclusion
Micro-frontend architecture helps teams work independently, release updates faster, and manage growing applications without getting in each other’s way. It brings the modular approach of backend systems to the frontend, making parallel development and team autonomy much easier.

But with this flexibility comes added complexity—in both the code and how teams coordinate. That’s why the best teams choose micro-frontends with purpose, not just to follow trends. It’s not about making the app look modern—it’s about helping teams move faster without causing issues. If your app is growing, your teams are expanding, and your release cycles are slowing down, micro-frontends could be the right next step for your frontend architecture.
