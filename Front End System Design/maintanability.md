# Front System Design - Maintainability

A maintainable frontend system supports fast iteration, easier onboarding, and long-term scalability. Through clean code architecture, modular design, comprehensive testing, and effective documentation, we reduce risk and enable consistent growth and smooth collaboration across teams.

## Key factors affecting maintainability

Achieving maintainability requires a deliberate approach to software development. Several key factors contribute to a frontend system that is easy to manage and extend over time:

### Code modularity

A clean, modular codebase, built with separation of concerns and reusable components, improves readability, reduces complexity, and simplifies collaboration.

- Architecture: (e.g. component-based)

- Separation of concerns (SoC) (e.g. MVC)

- Smart structure: (e.g. feature-based)

## Documentation

Even the best-written code can be difficult to maintain without clear documentation.

Clean code and the concept that the code should document itself are essential for long-term maintainability, but they are not a substitute for external documentation.

What Clean Code Documents Well
Clean code excels at explaining the "what" and "how" at a granular level. Well-named functions, clear variable names, and logical structure can make the immediate mechanics obvious:

```javascript
function calculateMonthlySubscriptionRevenue(activeSubscriptions, pricingTier) {
  return activeSubscriptions
    .filter((sub) => sub.status === "active")
    .reduce((total, sub) => total + pricingTier[sub.planId].monthlyPrice, 0);
}
```

This code is self-documenting about its immediate purpose and mechanics.

What Clean Code Cannot Document
Clean code fundamentally cannot capture the "why" - the business context, architectural decisions, trade-offs, and constraints that led to this implementation. It can't explain:

Why this particular algorithm was chosen over alternatives
What business requirements drove the design
Historical context about why certain seemingly odd patterns exist
Integration points and system boundaries
Performance considerations and optimization decisions
Regulatory or compliance requirements that influenced the code

The Documentation Gap
Even the cleanest code can't answer questions like "Why do we batch these API calls every 5 minutes instead of real-time?" or "Why does this error handling seem overly complex?" The code shows you that it happens, but not the business or technical reasoning behind it.
Effective Documentation Strategy
The best approach combines both:

Clean, self-documenting code for immediate clarity
Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for major design choices
README files for setup and context
Inline comments for non-obvious business logic or technical constraints
API documentation for integration points

Clean code reduces the need for documentation about basic mechanics, but it amplifies the importance of documenting the higher-level context that code simply cannot express.

Well-maintained README files, code comments, and design documents help onboard new developers and provide **_context_** for future changes.

Effective documentation helps new developers onboard faster and enables existing contributors to work without second-guessing architecture or intent. Types of documentation that matter:

Code comments: Explain non-obvious logic or edge cases inline, making functionality easier to understand and safely modify.

API documentation: Clearly define inputs, outputs, and expected behavior of internal or external APIs to ensure smooth integration.

Style guides: Document design systems, UI patterns, and reusable components to maintain visual and behavioral consistency. Tools like Storybook are especially effective for this in modern frontend stacks.

Automate documentation generation where possible to keep it up-to-date with code changes.

### Testing

Comprehensive testingâ€”unit, integration, and end-to-end, acts as a safety net that catches regressions early.

Unit testing: Tests individual functions or components in isolation.

Integration testing: Ensures different modules work together correctly.

Component tests: Ensures UI behaves correctly (e.g., with React testing library).

End-to-end (E2E) testing: Simulates real user interactions across the entire application.

Here are some good testing practices to follow:

#### Good Testing Practices

| Practice                                   | Tool(s)               | Why It Matters                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write tests alongside features             | Jest, Vitest          | Encourages test-driven thinking and keeps tests relevant to the code they cover  |
| Keep tests isolated, predictable, and fast | React Testing Library | Ensures tests focus on specific behaviors and remain stable across code changes  |
| Automate tests in CI/CD pipelines          | Cypress, Jest         | Detects issues early in the dev cycle, improving confidence and deployment speed |

> **Note:** Testing is most effective when integrated into the development workflow. Running automated tests within CI/CD pipelines ensures that every change is verified before being deployed, preventing defects from reaching production.

### Error handling and monitoring

Robust error handling prevents applications from failing silently or crashing unexpectedly. Logging, monitoring, and graceful fallbacks help developers detect issues quickly.

# Trade-offs

In software there are always trade-offs to consider.

For example, increasing modularity may introduce complexity in terms of inter-module communication.

Similarly, while comprehensive testing improves reliability, it also requires additional time and resources.

If you make something reusable, any change to it may impact multiple parts of the application, potentially introducing bugs or requiring additional testing. This is the cost of reusability, and it's essential to weigh these trade-offs when designing a system.

Server side rendering increases performance but it makes it less flexible, you lose on-request updates for example, and you have to consider the processing times when building (e.g. server side rendering 10Ks of products is not ideal at build time)

Balancing these factors is crucial for maintaining a healthy development process.
