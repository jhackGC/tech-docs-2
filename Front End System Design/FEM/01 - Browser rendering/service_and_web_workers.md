- Use Web Workers (run JavaScript in background threads, separate from UI thread)

  - **What Web Workers do:**
    - Execute JavaScript code in parallel to the main thread
    - Handle CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the UI
    - Cannot directly access DOM, but can communicate via message passing
    - Examples: data processing, image manipulation, calculations
  - **Service Workers** (different from Web Workers):
    - Act as proxy between app and network
    - Enable offline functionality and caching
    - Handle background sync and push notifications
